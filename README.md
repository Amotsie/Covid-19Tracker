A Spring Boot app which displays static data of covid cases in Italy Feb 2020, collected and saved on in memory H2 databse.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is just a basic demo used I used for learning the spring framework, no live Demo yet. Future upgrade would be to use 
an API to serve real time data instead of using stored static data. 

To run the app.

1. clone the repository.
2. import the project using the IDE of your choice be it eclise(STS) or IntelliJ.
3. Right-click on the project > Maven > Update Project... [or just hit Alt+F5]
